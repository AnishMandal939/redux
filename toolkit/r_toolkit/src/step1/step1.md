passing data from parent to childeren component as props , but was not able to display same result when passing from children to parent
i.e from home to App component, but worked from App to Home compoent

Creating file store.js for redux implementation and making another file with a name Reducer.js, this isnot compolsary

<!-- now import useDispatch from react-redux in Home -->
 we have useDispatch to trigger action
similarly we have useSlelctor to access value from state
